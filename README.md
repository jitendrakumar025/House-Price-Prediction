Retail price predictor
Overview
This dataset contains information about houses, including the number of rooms, retail price, address, city, square footage, number of toilets, and image ID. The goal is to predict the retail price of the houses based on the given features.

Dataset Details
index: Unique identifier for each house entry.
rooms: Number of rooms in the house.
retail_price: Retail price of the house (target variable).
address: Address of the house.
city: City where the house is located.
sqft: Square footage of the house.
toilets: Number of toilets in the house.
image_id: Identifier for the house image.
Data Preparation
Before using the dataset for analysis or prediction tasks, it is recommended to perform the following preprocessing steps:

Handle Missing Values: Check for missing values in the dataset and decide on an appropriate strategy for handling them (e.g., imputation or removal).
Feature Engineering: Explore potential feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful information from the given features (e.g., creating new features based on existing ones).
Data Scaling: If necessary, scale or normalize the numerical features to ensure they have similar ranges and distributions.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables (such as city) into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Model Training
To train a predictive model for house price prediction, you can follow these steps:

Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for regression tasks, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
Model Training: Train the selected model using the training data and evaluate its performance on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error, mean absolute error).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to improve performance further.
Model Evaluation: Finally, evaluate the trained model's performance on unseen data to assess its generalization capability and potential for real-world deployment.
Usage
You can use this dataset for various tasks, including but not limited to:

House price prediction
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering experiments
Model training and evaluation
